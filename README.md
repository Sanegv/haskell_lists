# Haskell List

This is an implementation of some Haskell standard functions from Data.List.

##Â Goals

The main goal of this repo is to learn through practice. I want to implement as many functions as possible, so I can better understand what they do. 

This repo is not for use, as it does not provide anything new from the standard lib, and some implementations might be less good than the ones from GHC.
